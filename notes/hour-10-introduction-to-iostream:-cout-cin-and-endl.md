## ðŸ“„ Summary: 1.5 â€” Introduction to iostream: cout, cin, and endl

This lesson introduces the C++ input/output (I/O) capabilities provided by the standard library.

### 1\. The I/O Library and `std::cout`

  * **Header:** To use I/O functions, you must include the **`iostream`** header file at the top of your code: `#include <iostream>`.

  * **`std::cout` (Character Output):** Used to send data (text, numbers, or variables) to the console.

  * **Insertion Operator (`<<`):** Used with `std::cout` to direct data toward the console. It can be chained to concatenate multiple items in a single statement.

    ```cpp
    std::cout << "The value is: " << x; // Concatenates text and variable x
    ```

### 2\. Newline Output: `std::endl` vs. `\n`

To move the cursor to the next line on the console, a **newline** character is required.

  * **`std::endl` (End Line):** Outputs a newline **and immediately flushes the output buffer**. Flushing is an expensive (slow) operation.

  * **`\n` (Newline Character):** A special escape sequence that outputs a newline **without flushing the buffer**. It's more efficient and can be embedded within double-quoted strings or used alone (conventionally single-quoted, `'\n'`).

    ```cpp
    std::cout << "Line 1.\n";          // Preferred: outputs newline without flushing
    std::cout << "Line 2." << '\n';    // Also preferred
    std::cout << "Line 3." << std::endl; // Less efficient
    ```

  * **Best Practice:** Prefer **`\n`** over `std::endl` when writing text to the console.

### 3\. Buffering in I/O

The C++ I/O system uses a **buffer** (a region of memory) to collect data requests before transferring them in batches to the output device (for `std::cout`) or from the input device (for `std::cin`).

  * **Buffered Output:** Data sent to `std::cout` is first stored in a buffer and is only displayed when the buffer is **flushed** (e.g., automatically, or explicitly by `std::endl`). Buffering improves performance by minimizing the number of times data has to be sent to the output device.
  * **Buffered Input:** Characters entered by the user (including the newline character from pressing Enter) are stored in `std::cin`'s input buffer. This allows one line of user input to satisfy multiple extraction requests.

-----

### 4\. `std::cin` and Input

  * **`std::cin` (Character Input):** Used to read input (typically from the keyboard).

  * **Extraction Operator (`>>`):** Used with `std::cin` to move data from the input buffer into a variable.

    ```cpp
    int x{};         // Initialize the variable first
    std::cin >> x;   // Extract input from buffer and store in x
    ```

  * **Input Process:**

    1.  Leading whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines from prior input) is discarded.
    2.  If the buffer is empty, `std::cin` waits for user input.
    3.  The `>>` operator extracts characters until it encounters whitespace (like a space or `\n`) or a character that is invalid for the variable's type.
    4.  If extraction fails (e.g., trying to read a letter into an `int`), the variable is set to 0, and `std::cin` enters a "bad state," causing future extractions to fail.

  * **Multiple Inputs:** Multiple values can be read in a single statement, separated by whitespace from the user:

    ```cpp
    std::cin >> x >> y; // Reads two values and stores them in x and y
    ```
