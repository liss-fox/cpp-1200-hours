## üìÑ Summary: 0.3 ‚Äî Introduction to C/C++

### üï∞Ô∏è The Evolution of the C Language

* **C (1972):** Developed by **Dennis Ritchie** at Bell Labs primarily as a **systems programming language** (used to write operating systems).
* **C's Core Goals:** To be minimalistic, easy to compile, produce **efficient code**, allow fast memory access, and provide **excellent portability** (which allowed Unix to be easily adopted across different computer types).
* **K&R (1978):** The book "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie, which served as the **de facto standard**.
* **Formal Standards:** **C89/C90** (first formal standards, 1989/1990) and **C99** (introduced new features, 1999).

### ‚ú® C++: The Superset

* **C++ (1979):** Developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** at Bell Labs as an **extension** to C.
* **Key Innovation:** Adds support for **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. It is essentially a superset of C (though not strictly true today).
* **Standardization:**
    * **C++98 (1998):** The first formal ISO standard, ensuring consistency across different compilers and platforms.
    * **Major Updates:** **C++11** (considered the new modern baseline), C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23 (updates occur roughly every three years).
    * *Naming Convention:* Standards are informally named by the last two digits of the publication year (e.g., C++20).

### üí° Philosophy and Application

* **Design Philosophy (C/C++):** **"Trust the programmer."**
    * This grants **great freedom** but also means the language won't prevent the programmer from making sense-defying mistakes. Knowing what *not* to do is crucial.
* **C++ Strengths:** Excels where **high performance** and **precise control** over memory/resources are needed.
    * *Examples:* **Video games**, real-time systems, financial applications (high-frequency trading), embedded software, and AI/neural networks.
    * It remains one of the **most popular compiled languages** globally.
* **Learning Path:** You **do not need to know C** to start with C++. C++ is generally recommended for most modern projects, while C is reserved for niche cases like embedded systems or specific language interfacing.
