Summary: 0.5 ‚Äî Introduction to the Compiler, Linker, and Libraries

This lesson covers the final stages of the C++ development process (Steps 4‚Äì7): converting source code into an executable program.

4. Compiling Source Code

    Tool: The C++ Compiler.

    Process: The compiler processes each source code file (.cpp) and performs two tasks:

        Syntax Check: Ensures the code adheres to C++ language rules. Aborts the process and reports an error if a violation is found.

        Translation: Converts C++ code into machine language instructions.

    Output: An Object File (e.g., name.o or name.obj). Each .cpp file generates one object file, containing machine code and data for later steps.

5. Linking Object Files and Libraries

    Tool: The Linker.

    Process (Linking): The linker's job is to combine all object files and libraries to produce the final output file (usually an executable file).

        Resolve Dependencies: Connects references from one object file to their definitions in others. If a definition is missing, a linker error occurs.

        Incorporate Libraries: Links in precompiled code packages.

        Final Output: Creates the executable file that can be launched.

    Building: The term used to refer to the entire process of converting source code to a runnable executable (compiling + linking).

Libraries

    C++ Standard Library: An extensive library (e.g., the Input/Output library or iostream) that provides core functionality and is typically linked by default.

    3rd Party Libraries: Optional libraries from independent entities that provide specialized features (e.g., sound playing) to significantly speed up development.

6. & 7. Testing and Debugging

    Testing: The process of running the executable and assessing whether the software works as expected with various inputs.

    Debugging: The process of finding and fixing programming errors when the program does not behave as intended.

üõ†Ô∏è Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

    Steps 3, 4, 5, and 7 require separate software (editor, compiler, linker, debugger).

    An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software package that bundles and integrates all these features into a single environment for streamlined development.
