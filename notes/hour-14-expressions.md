## ðŸ“„ Summary: 1.10 â€” Introduction to Expressions

This lesson defines an **expression** and explains its fundamental role in calculating values within C++ programs.

### 1. Expressions and Evaluation

* **Definition:** An **expression** is a non-empty sequence of literals, variables, operators, and/or function calls that **calculates a single value**.
    * *Examples:* `5`, `x`, `2 + 3`, `five()`, `(2 * 3) + 4`
* **Evaluation:** The process of executing an expression to produce a result.
* **Result:** The single value produced by the evaluation of an expression (also called the return value).
* **Key Insight:** Wherever C++ expects a single value, you can substitute it with any expression, and the compiler will evaluate that expression to produce the required value.

| Entity | How it Evaluates |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Literal** (`5`) | Evaluates to its own value (`5`). |
| **Variable** (`x`) | Evaluates to the value currently held by the variable. |
| **Operator** (`+`) | Uses its operands to evaluate to a new value (e.g., `2 + 3` evaluates to `5`). |
| **Function Call** (`five()`) | Evaluates to the value the function returns. |

### 2. Expression Statements

* Expressions **do not end in a semicolon** and cannot be compiled alone (e.g., `x = 5` won't compile).
* An **expression statement** is created by following any expression with a semicolon (e.g., `x = 5;`).
* When an expression statement is executed, the expression is evaluated. Any return value generated by the expression is typically **discarded** if it's not used, which is fine for expressions used primarily for their **side effects** (like assignment or output).
* **Useless Expression Statements:** Expressions that calculate a value but have no side effects (e.g., `2 * 3;`) are syntactically valid but useless, and many compilers will issue a warning about them.

### 3. Terminology

* **Subexpression:** An expression that is used as an operand within a larger expression (e.g., `4` and `5` are subexpressions of `4 + 5`).
* **Full Expression:** An expression that is not a subexpression (e.g., the complete expression `x = 4 + 5` is a full expression).
* **Compound Expression:** An expression that contains two or more uses of operators (e.g., `x = 4 + 5` uses both `=` and `+`).
