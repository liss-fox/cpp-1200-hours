üñ•Ô∏è Programs and Execution

    Computer Program: A sequence of instructions that directs a computer to perform actions in a specified order.

    Programming Language: A language designed to facilitate writing instructions for computers.

    Running/Executing: When a computer performs the actions described by the program instructions.

    Hardware vs. Software:

        Hardware: Physical components (CPU, Memory, Interactive devices, Storage).

        Software: Programs designed to be executed on hardware.

    Platform: A compatible set of hardware and software (OS, browser, etc.) that provides the environment for programs to run (e.g., Windows on x86 CPU).

    Portability: A program that can be easily transferred from one platform to another. Porting is the act of modifying a program to run on a different platform.

üß± Language Levels

1. Low-Level Languages (Machine & Assembly)

    Machine Language (Machine Code): The native language of the CPU, consisting of binary digits (bits, 0s and 1s). It is specific to a CPU family (Instruction Set Architecture).

        Example: 10110000 01100001

    Assembly Language: A more human-readable representation of machine language, using mnemonics (e.g., mov al, 0x61).

        Requires an assembler to translate it into machine language.

    Downsides of Low-Level Languages: Not portable, require detailed knowledge of the architecture, hard to understand, and lack complex capabilities.

    Primary Benefit: They are fast (used for performance-critical sections).

2. High-Level Languages (C, C++, Java, etc.)

    Definition: Provide a high level of abstraction from the underlying hardware architecture.

        Example: a = 97; (Abstracts away specific memory location and CPU instruction).

    Benefits:

        Portability: Easier to write cross-platform code.

        Simplicity & Readability: Instructions resemble natural language/math, requiring fewer lines of code for the same task.

        Built-in Capabilities: Include features for common tasks (e.g., text manipulation) that dramatically reduce complexity and development time.

‚öôÔ∏è Translation Methods

High-level code must be translated into machine language:
Method	Program	Process	Efficiency & Dependency
Compiling	Compiler	Translates source code into machine code before execution, packaged into an executable.	Very efficient. Executable does not require the compiler to run. (Typical for C++).
Interpreting	Interpreter	Executes source code instructions directly (on the fly).	Less efficient (translation happens every time). The interpreter must be installed on every machine.

üè∑Ô∏è Nomenclature (C++)

    While technically a High-Level Language, C++ is sometimes inaccurately called "low-level" compared to modern scripting languages (e.g., Python).

    Author's Note: C++ is more accurately described as a Mid-Level Language because it allows the programmer to work at both higher (convenience) and lower (performance) levels of abstraction.

‚ö†Ô∏è Rules, Best Practices, and Warnings

    Rule: Instructions that must be followed (required by the language); failure means the program won't work.

    Best Practice: Things that should be done (conventional or superior way of doing things).ge of the CPU, consisting of binary digits (**bits**, 0s and 1s). It is specific to a **CPU family** (**Instruction Set Architecture**).
